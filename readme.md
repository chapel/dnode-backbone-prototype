# Dnode + Backbone Prototype Example

This was purely a prototype of using Dnode and Backbone.js together for server syncing of data.

```database.coffee``` is a wrapper for CouchDB that was supposed to be used with the Backbone+Dnode syncing.

This is on Github for historical reasons. **Use at your own risk.**
